Mountain Mesh is a community group building a mesh network in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We are a group of makers, tech enthusiasts, and amateur radio operators who are passionate about building a resilient, decentralized, and community-owned communications network. You can learn more about us on our [About page](/about/).

## Map

There are two ways to check out our mesh in real time:

- [our MeshView instance](https://view.mtnme.sh/map)
- [our instance of the `LiamCottle Meshtastic Map`](https://map.MtnMe.sh/)

Here's what it looked like as of June 4th, 2025:

Both will let you get some information about what all those little dots represent, and will let you see new nodes that have come online since we last grapped a screenshot.
