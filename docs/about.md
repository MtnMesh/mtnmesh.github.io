# About Us

Mountain Mesh is a community group building a mesh network in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We are a group of makers, tech enthusiasts, and amateur radio operators who are passionate about building a resilient, decentralized, and community-owned communications network.

Our community is currently focused on deploying the [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) platform; an open-source, long-range, low-power mesh networking solution that uses inexpensive, off-the-shelf LoRa radios. We are working to build a network that can provide emergency communications, support local events, and foster collaboration among our members.

The Mountain Mesh network operates in the 915 MHz ISM band, which is legal for unlicensed use in the United States. We are committed to operating within the bounds of the law and promoting responsible radio use.
